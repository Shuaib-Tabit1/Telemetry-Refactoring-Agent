### Explanation

This unified patch ensures that every code path involved in telemetry—tests, application components, workers, and ASP.NET Core integrations—explicitly sets the required `sprocname` span attribute. We add:

- `[Span]` or `SpanAttribute` decorations on test methods and health‐check methods to satisfy static span annotations.
- Runtime span instrumentation (e.g. `Tracer.StartSpan`, `ActivitySource.StartActivity`) around key operations—worker loops, service startup/shutdown, delegate runs, buffered queue retrieval, and hosted‐service lifecycles.
- Calls to `SetAttribute("sprocname", …)` or `.WithTag("sprocname", …)` immediately after starting spans to attach the stored-procedure name to each telemetry span.
- Adjusted test verifications to assert presence of the `'sprocname'` tag.
- Added comments or placeholders where custom logic is needed to derive the procedure name.

With these changes applied consistently, all telemetry spans will include the mandatory `sprocname` attribute, enabling downstream trace correlation and analysis.
