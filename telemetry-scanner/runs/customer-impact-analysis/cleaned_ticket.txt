**Issue**: Missing Customer/Account ID Attributes in Telemetry Spans for Customer Impact Analysis

**Problem Description**:
Our customer impact analysis tool can identify impacted accounts during incidents but cannot calculate the total customer base or impact percentage because the service is not consistently logging customer/account IDs in telemetry spans.

**Specific Example**:
- Service: document-doc2pdf-clm
- Issue: When querying for total customers served by this service during a time window, the query returns no results
- Root Cause: The service is not logging customer/account ID attributes in the correct span attributes
- Impact: Cannot calculate customer impact percentage, business risk assessment is incomplete

**Current State**:
- We can extract impacted accounts from problematic traces (by traceId lookup)
- We cannot get total customer count because spans lack customer/account ID attributes
- Kusto queries filtering by service_name + site and summarizing by accountId return empty results

**Expected Outcome**:
- All spans for document-doc2pdf-clm service should include customer/account ID attributes
- Telemetry should capture customer context consistently across all operations
- Customer impact analysis should be able to calculate total customers served and impact percentages

**Technical Requirements**:
- Add customer.id or account.id span attributes to all relevant operations
- Ensure customer context is captured early in request processing and propagated through the call chain
- Maintain consistency with existing telemetry attribute naming conventions

**Priority**: High - impacts incident response and customer impact assessment capabilities
