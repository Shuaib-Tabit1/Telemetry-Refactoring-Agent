**Issue**: Customer ID and Account ID are missing in Span Attributes for Customer Impact Analysis

**Problem Description**:
Customer ID and Account ID are not showing in Span Attributes for iam-tasks service spans. The customer impact analysis team needs these attributes to appear in every span so they can calculate customer impact percentages during incidents.

**Current State**:
- Spans are created with ActivitySource.StartActivity calls throughout the codebase
- Customer and account context is available but not being added to spans
- Customer impact queries return incomplete data due to missing span attributes

**Expected Outcome**:
- Every span should include customer.id span attribute
- Every span should include account.id span attribute  
- These attributes should be set immediately after ActivitySource.StartActivity calls
- Customer impact analysis queries should return complete data

**Technical Requirements**:
- Find all ActivitySource.StartActivity calls in the codebase
- Add span.SetAttribute("customer.id", customerId) after each StartActivity call
- Add span.SetAttribute("account.id", accountId) after each StartActivity call
- Ensure customer context is available where needed

**Priority**: High - impacts incident response and customer impact assessment capabilities
