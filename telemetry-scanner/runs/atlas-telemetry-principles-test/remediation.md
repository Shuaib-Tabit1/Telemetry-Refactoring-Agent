# Telemetry Refactoring Remediation Report

## Executive Summary
**Ticket Category**: INSTRUMENTATION
**Confidence Level**: high
**Files Modified**: 30
**Validation Score**: 0.64/1.0
**Risk Assessment**: HIGH

## Intent Analysis
**Semantic Description**: Add HTTP_REFERER and HTTP_RESPONSE_REDIRECT_LOCATION headers as span attributes on CLM web HTTP request spans.
**Operation Type**: multi_file
**Complexity Score**: 5/10
**Estimated Impact**: 3 files

### Sub-tasks Identified
1. Search clm-web solution for existing OpenTelemetry boot-strapper, ActivitySource registrations, and any custom span enrichment middleware.
2. Confirm the best place in the ASP.NET pipeline to read request headers early (for Referer) and response headers late (for Location) while staying on the same server span. Usually a custom middleware registered immediately after UseRouting and before UseEndpoints.
3. Inside chosen middleware, capture `HttpContext.Request.Headers["Referer"]` (case-insensitive). If not null/empty, call `Activity.Current?.SetTag("HTTP_REFERER", refererValue)`.
4. After `await _next(context)` returns, inspect `context.Response.StatusCode` for 301,302,303,307,308. If match and `Location` header exists, call `Activity.Current?.SetTag("HTTP_RESPONSE_REDIRECT_LOCATION", locationValue)`.
5. Add `app.UseMiddleware<RequestEnrichmentMiddleware>();` in Startup.cs/Program.cs immediately after routing.
6. Run Solution analyzers and stylecop; ensure no new warnings. Confirm no PII violations with security linter (full URLs allowed per data-privacy guidelines).
7. Add or extend integration tests that spin up TestServer, issue request with Referer header and simulate redirect response to verify both tags arrive in exported spans (use InMemoryExporter).
8. Run clm-web locally with OTLP exporter pointed at dev collector + console exporter. Trigger BrowseDocuments.aspx which redirects via SSO. Observe span attributes in console and Grafana/Jaeger.
9. Promote branch to Demo slot via CI/CD. Enable feature flag `Telemetry.RedirectEnrichment` if gated (optional).
10. Execute the expected Kusto query provided in ticket. Confirm both columns populated for new traffic.
11. Run load test comparing p95 latency before/after. Confirm added tags do not degrade response time >1 ms or increase span size >200 B.
12. Merge to main, tag release, promote via staged ring deployment (Test → Staging → Prod). Monitor logs & Kusto dashboards.
13. Update RUNBOOK.md and Telemetry_Conventions.md with new attributes. Close ticket after stakeholder sign-off.

## Code Changes
```diff
Error generating patch: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "This model's maximum context length is 200000 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 226543 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'messages', 'code': 'context_length_exceeded'}}

## Implementation Details
# Patch generation failed - manual implementation required

## Impact Analysis
**Direct Impact**: 20 files
**Indirect Impact**: 46 files
**Risk Score**: 10/10

### Affected Architectural Patterns
- dependency_injection
- singleton
- factory

### Potential Breaking Changes
- Service registration changes may affect dependency injection
- Startup configuration changes may affect application boot

### Test Requirements
- Middleware pipeline integration tests
- Unit tests for modified methods
- Service registration validation tests
- OpenTelemetry span validation tests
- Integration tests for telemetry data collection

## Validation Results
**Overall Score**: 0.64/1.0
**Tests Passed**: 7/12

### Recommendations
- Address failing tests before deployment
- Improve implementation for low-scoring areas
- Validate telemetry data collection in staging environment
