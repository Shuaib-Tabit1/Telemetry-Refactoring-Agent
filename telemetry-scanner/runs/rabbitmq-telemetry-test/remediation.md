```diff

It seems the provided code base does not contain any usage of `BasicConsume` nor any RabbitMQ consumer implementation where the requested instrumentation could be added.  
Without the relevant consumer code, no accurate, compile-safe diff can be produced to fulfil the intent.

Please supply the file(s) that actually call `BasicConsume` (or otherwise receive messages from RabbitMQ).
