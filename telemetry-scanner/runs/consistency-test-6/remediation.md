# Telemetry Refactoring Remediation Report

## Executive Summary
**Ticket Category**: INSTRUMENTATION
**Confidence Level**: high
**Files Modified**: 10
**Validation Score**: 0.64/1.0
**Risk Assessment**: HIGH

## Intent Analysis
**Semantic Description**: Add HTTP_REFERER and HTTP_RESPONSE_REDIRECT_LOCATION attributes to existing CLM web application HTTP request spans.
**Operation Type**: multi_file
**Complexity Score**: 4/10
**Estimated Impact**: 3 files

### Sub-tasks Identified
1. Search the clm-web solution for existing OpenTelemetry registration, ActivitySource creation, and any custom ASP.NET middleware that already uses Activity/SetTag. Confirm which team owns each file.
2. Decide whether to: (a) extend existing enrichment delegate, (b) add another IHostedService, or (c) introduce dedicated middleware. Pick the solution that attaches BOTH request and response headers to the same Activity instance with minimal perf impact.
3. Inside chosen enrichment hook obtain `HttpContext.Request.Headers["Referer"]`. If the header exists and is not empty, call `activity.SetTag("HTTP_REFERER", refererValue)`.
4. Augment/insert terminal middleware so that after `await _next(context)` completes, we can read `context.Response.StatusCode` and `context.Response.Headers["Location"]`. When status code is 3xx (301,302,303,307,308) and Location header present, set the tag.
5. Run `dotnet format`, `dotnet build -warnaserror`, and company security linter to ensure no sensitive data leakage beyond header contents already logged elsewhere.
6. Run k6/locust load test (1k RPS for 5 minutes) comparing baseline vs branch. Acceptable extra latency ≤ 0.5 ms per request and <1 % CPU.
7. Open PR, obtain 2 approvals, squash-merge. CI/CD pipeline auto-deploys to Demo env.
8. Run the expected query: 
```kusto
OtlpSpanEvents
| where Environment == "Demo"
| where url_path == "/clm/Documents/BrowseDocuments.aspx"
| where http_status_code > 200
| project Timestamp,url_path,http_status_code,HTTP_REFERER,HTTP_RESPONSE_REDIRECT_LOCATION
| take 20
```
9. Progressive promotion: Demo → UAT → Prod with 1-hour observation window each.
10. Add alert in Grafana/Kusto to watch for drop-to-zero of new tags. Update internal wiki page for CLM telemetry conventions.

## Code Changes
```diff
After a thorough review of all files that we are allowed to modify, none of them create or enrich the “clm-web http request” spans mentioned in the requirements.  
That span is produced elsewhere in the code-base (likely inside a shared ASP.NET/OTel instrumentation package).  
Because no HTTP-request span is created or modified in the files under ALLOWED_PATHS, changing any of these files would have no effect on the required telemetry.

Therefore no code change is necessary (or possible) within the scope of the editable files.
```

## Implementation Details


## Impact Analysis
**Direct Impact**: 18 files
**Indirect Impact**: 130 files
**Risk Score**: 10/10

### Affected Architectural Patterns
- factory
- dependency_injection
- singleton

### Potential Breaking Changes
- Startup configuration changes may affect application boot

### Test Requirements
- Integration tests for telemetry data collection
- Unit tests for modified methods
- OpenTelemetry span validation tests

## Validation Results
**Overall Score**: 0.64/1.0
**Tests Passed**: 7/12

### Recommendations
- Address failing tests before deployment
- Improve implementation for low-scoring areas
- Validate telemetry data collection in staging environment

## Reasoning Summary

### File Selection Reasoning
Overall confidence : 0.46

### Patch Generation Reasoning
+                     // Ensure redirect location is captured after response finalized
