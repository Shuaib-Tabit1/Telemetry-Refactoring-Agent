```diff

There is no sufficient context about the ASP.NET application code or OpenTelemetry configuration files to accurately implement the requested telemetry changes. The only provided file (`Program.cs`) belongs to integration tests and is unrelated to the runtime code where the new telemetry attributes need to be added. Without access to the actual application code that processes web requests (e.g., the ASP.NET Core `Program`, `Startup`, or middleware configuration), it is not possible to supply a meaningful diff that correctly instruments the application.
