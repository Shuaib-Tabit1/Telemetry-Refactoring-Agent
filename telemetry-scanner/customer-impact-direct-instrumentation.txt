**Issue**: Customer and Account ID attributes are missing in individual span attributes for Customer Impact Analysis

**Problem Description**:
Each span in the iam-tasks service needs to have customer.id and account.id span attributes added directly to the span creation calls throughout the codebase, not via a processor.

**Specific Example**:
- Current code: `using var span = ActivitySource.StartActivity("ProcessOrder");`
- Required code: `using var span = ActivitySource.StartActivity("ProcessOrder"); span.SetAttribute("customer.id", customerId); span.SetAttribute("account.id", accountId);`

**Technical Requirements**:
- Add span.SetAttribute("customer.id", customerId) calls directly in the code wherever spans are created
- Add span.SetAttribute("account.id", accountId) calls directly in the code wherever spans are created  
- Modify existing StartActivity calls across all service files to include these attributes
- Ensure customer context is available where spans are created (through dependency injection or context passing)

**Expected Outcome**:
- All StartActivity calls in the codebase should be followed by SetAttribute calls for customer.id and account.id
- No processor or global enrichment - each span creation site should explicitly set these attributes
- Direct code instrumentation in multiple files across the service

**Implementation Approach**:
- Find all ActivitySource.StartActivity calls across the codebase
- Add direct span.SetAttribute calls after each StartActivity
- Ensure customer/account context is accessible at each span creation site
- Prefer direct instrumentation over processors for performance reasons

**Priority**: High - impacts incident response and customer impact assessment capabilities
