# TODO: Implement the static analysis scanner.
# This module will use the rules from rules.py to scan the source code
# for potential telemetry gaps without using an LLM. This is useful for
# finding common, pattern-based issues quickly.
# It could use Tree-sitter for robust AST-based analysis or regex for simpler patterns.
